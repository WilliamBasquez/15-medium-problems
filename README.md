# 15-medium-problems

1) Range Sum of BST

A) Can the tree be empty? what do we do in this case?
B) IDEAL helped me by making me rationalize this problem, in terms of the data structure I'm working with, I opted to use recursion to solve this problem; and now looking back at my answer and the given one, I could have used a better approach.
C) This 'guideline' was more explicit, in terms where it made me write what I did, some examples, it made me look for cases where my code was not going to work, and mostly it made me look for a better answer, although I came up with the same answer.

2) Maximum binary tree
A) What happens when the list is empty?
B) IDEAL was a good ground to step on as a basic procedure to solve this problem as it made look at this problem in a general way, and i could solve it
C) Same as IDEAL, but it reasured me of my answer because after working the examples i did, i got the right answer.

3) Insert into a Binary Search Tree
A) Is there an unique answer? 
B) IDEAL helped me develop a simple strategy, like a little battle plan that helped me tackle this problem in an organized way.
C) This reinforced the 'game plan' i got from IDEAL

4) Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid
A) Can a closing parenthesis appear before an opening one?
B) IDEAL helped me solve this problem pretty quickly, also I had seen a similar problem in a CS class that I'm taking
C) This just reinforced my answer as a correct one

5) Find All Duplicates in an Array
A) Does it have to be O(n) and no extra space? What is another acceptable running time?
B) IDEAL is still a basic concept to follow when it comes to a bit more complicated problems, and in this case is still being a base to lay knowledge and then Duke's 7 steps come in and helped me even more
C) This always helps me to either make sure I'm doing the write thing, or it ensures me that the answer that I have is correct, it may not be the best one, but it's correct

6) Find Bottom Left Tree Value
A) Can i implement my own function?
B) IDEAL was not a very good help in this especific problem, and it confused me a bit more
C) This helped a bit more, because it made me write down the examples and what i did and how i did it

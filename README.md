# 15-medium-problems

1) Range Sum of BST

A) Can the tree be empty? what do we do in this case?
B) I could not solve this problem, so I looked up a way to traverse a tree iterative in order to use this and solve the problem, I got the answer, but it was not my code
C) Same as IDEAL, could not come to an answer

2) Maximum binary tree

A) What happens when the list is empty?
B) IDEAL was a good ground to step on as a basic procedure to solve this problem as it made look at this problem in a general way, and i could solve it
C) Same as IDEAL, but it reasured me of my answer because after working the examples i did, i got the right answer.

3) Insert into a Binary Search Tree

A) Is there an unique answer? 
B) IDEAL helped me develop a simple strategy, like a little battle plan that helped me tackle this problem in an organized way.
C) This reinforced the 'game plan' i got from IDEAL

4) Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid

A) Can a closing parenthesis appear before an opening one?
B) IDEAL helped me solve this problem pretty quickly, also I had seen a similar problem in a CS class that I'm taking
C) This just reinforced my answer as a correct one

5) Find All Duplicates in an Array

A) Does it have to be O(n) and no extra space? What is another acceptable running time?
B) IDEAL is still a basic concept to follow when it comes to a bit more complicated problems, and in this case is still being a base to lay knowledge and then Duke's 7 steps come in and helped me even more
C) This always helps me to either make sure I'm doing the write thing, or it ensures me that the answer that I have is correct, it may not be the best one, but it's correct

6) Find Bottom Left Tree Value

A) Can i implement my own function?
B) IDEAL was not a very good help in this especific problem, and it confused me a bit more
C) This helped a bit more, because it made me write down the examples and what i did and how i did it

7) Top K Frequent Elements

A) Do we care about space complexity?
B) IDEAL helped me to find a way and to come to the conclusion that I needed a more explicit way to solve this problem, and like other times, this is a good base to solve problems.
C) These steps explained a little more the process of solving the problem, as it's pictures and examples made me come up with even more cases where my code can solve such problems.

8) Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

A) What if the recursive solution is 'better'? What happens if the tree is empty?
B) I had so look up the answer for this problem, since i could not find a solution
C) Duke made me do examples, but i still could not solve this problem

9) Keys and Rooms

A) No questions
B) IDEAL did not made the problem more clear, as the problem itself is very explanatory
C) Same as with IDEAL, but it helped me code a solution and test it

10) Single Element in a Sorted Array

A) What happens if the array only has 1 item? Can we assume the len of the array is always odd?
B) IDEAL was a good guideline to get started
C) These steps took me a step further compared to IDEAL
